# Government Blockchain System

This is a Python-based implementation of a Government Blockchain System that allows you to simulate and interact with a blockchain for managing land registry updates and citizen identity records. It leverages the Streamlit framework for the user interface and hashlib for hash calculations.

## Features

- **Land Registry Updates**: Simulate land registry updates by entering the location of land, recording transactions, and viewing the blockchain's history.

- **Citizen Identity**: Simulate adding new citizen identities by entering their names, recording transactions, and viewing the blockchain's history.

- **Genesis Block**: The system starts with a Genesis Block, and all subsequent transactions are linked in a chain, ensuring data integrity and immutability.

## How to Use

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.

2. Install the required dependencies using `pip install pandas streamlit`.

3. Run the application using `streamlit run blockchain.py`.

4. Choose between "Land Registry" and "Citizen Identity" tabs to perform actions.

5. Simulate land registry updates or add new identities by providing the necessary information.

6. View the blockchain's history to see recorded transactions, timestamps, and hash values.
